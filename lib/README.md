# Lib

The Lib is a shared library used across multiple Shrike components. It provides common functions and models to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication.

## Features

- Neo data conversion methods.
- Database path handling.
- Will be expanded with other functions and models as needed.

## Getting Started
